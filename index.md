Visually Rich documents refer to physical and digital documents in which visual cues play an important role in document semantics. Examples include posters, banners, forms, and magazine articles. A number of recent works have proposed novel solutions for named entity recognition, relation extraction, layout analysis, classification, and retrieval for these documents. We discuss some of them in this series.
