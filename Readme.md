# Visually Rich Documents (VRD)

## A list of recent papers on various tasks for Visually Rich Documents

A lot of interesting works have been published in recent years on Visually Rich Documents. What makes tasks defined on these documents interesting is the multimodal nature of the document. We hope to provide a list of interesting papers to serve as a reference for researchers interested in this domain. The list below curates recent works published in ACL anthology, VLDB, SIGMOD, AAAI and NeurIPS affiliated conferences and workshops in no particular order.
